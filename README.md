# KaggleZeroToAll

After knowing basics of machine learning, deep learning, and TensorFlow/Keras, what's the next?

Kaggle provides many interesting problems for machine learning experts. 
This repository hosts interesting Kaggle problems and show how to solve these problems using decent deep learning models.

## Kaggle problem naming 
k0-00-quick_title.py (or ipynb)

* difficulty(k0, k1, ... k9): 0: easy, 5: normal, 9: very difficult
* k0-XX: 00 serial number
* quick_title: quick title for the Kaggle data

## Content of each file
Please see k0-00-template.ipynb

* Kaggle name
* dataset/problem description
* loading data
* model to solve the problem
* results
* future work and exercises
